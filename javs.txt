By the end of this module, students:
will know the basics of object-oriented programming such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and composition;


would have refactored procedural code to object-oriented code;


have been introduced to DevOps by using GitHub actions to build, test and package their programs;


have programmed a client-server architecture system from scratch;


will know the fundamentals of network programming by programming with sockets;


have written a multi-user system using thread-based concurrency; and


will learn how to implement a custom application protocol with JSON.


Programming
Java Fundamentals: How to use the basic programming constructs in Java to mould the design of a program.


Encapsulation: Create classes to implement behaviour, hide and govern access to data.


Inheritance: Use abstraction as an instrument of design.


Polymorphism: Implement specialisation of objects at run-time, based on the abstraction designed.


Composition: Combine objects to create more complex objects.
